Vong v1
============================================================================================================================================
This is a pong game where you control the paddles by making sound. You can play as:
1. Both paddles. Either rally with yourself or play against a friend.
2. Left paddle. Control the left paddle with volume to beat the AI.
3. Right paddle. Control the right paddle with pitch to beat the AI.
4. Neither paddle. Watch the computer play itself if you're a perv.

This doesn't really work well with certain mics. It works best on Macs, probably. It might take some getting used to to play the right paddle (pitch) accurately depending on which mic you use. The left paddle (volume) is easier to control.

The resource files are included. I don't know where to put them; it worked in Eclipse, but it never works with a JAR. I could never figure out how to deal with this stupid thing. So none of the sound effects or music work, and you can't recalibrate the mic ingame. I don't really care because we turned this in for a school project in the form of an Eclipse workspace that the teacher will open, and everything works if that is done.

Made by Fatalbert (aka Morshu9001) and nueRav. All music by nueRav except for music4, which is something from YouTube.
